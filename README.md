# NimbleTest

About:

This is an app developed by me, for a company's challenge.

You can see a Figma design UI in this link:

And this link is to access to the API documentation:

I used Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, Hilt, LiveData, SecurePreferences and Coil.

Start:

For the app's correct functionament, you must declarate the next values in your "local.properties" 's file

CLIENT_ID_RELEASE = "replaceWithYours"
SECRET_ID_RELEASE = "replaceWithYours"
CLIENT_ID_DEBUG = "replaceWithYours"
SECRET_ID_DEBUG = "replaceWithYours"


You can get the client and secret ID in the API's link. Release is for "Production Server" and debug is for "Mock Server"


Comment: I like to say, I did this completely project in 5 days. And 5 days ago, I have never even saw something about Jetpack Compose.
And, unfortunately, today it's my deadline, and I didn't make Integration Test.
I never saw how to do it before, anyway.
